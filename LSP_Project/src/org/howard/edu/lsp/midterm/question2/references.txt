USER PROMPT:
I'm working on a Java assignment to create an AreaCalculator with overloaded methods. I need to create four area methods for different shapes: circle, rectangle, triangle, and square. Each should throw IllegalArgumentException for non-positive dimensions. Can you help me start with the method signatures?

AI RESPONSE:
Here are the method signatures you'll need:

public static double area(double radius) // circle
public static double area(double width, double height) // rectangle  
public static double area(int base, int height) // triangle
public static double area(int side) // square

Remember to include the IllegalArgumentException checks in each method.

USER PROMPT:
I fixed the duplicate main error, but now I need to make sure my output matches exactly what's required. The assignment wants:

"Circle radius 3.0 → area = 28.274333882308138"
"Rectangle 5.0 x 2.0 → area = 10.0"
"Triangle base 10, height 6 → area = 30.0"
"Square side 4 → area = 16.0"

And I need to demonstrate exception handling. Can you show me the exact System.out.println statements and try-catch structure?

AI RESPONSE:
Here's the exact output formatting you need:

java
System.out.println("Circle radius 3.0 → area = " + AreaCalculator.area(3.0));
System.out.println("Rectangle 5.0 x 2.0 → area = " + AreaCalculator.area(5.0, 2.0));
System.out.println("Triangle base 10, height 6 → area = " + AreaCalculator.area(10, 6));
System.out.println("Square side 4 → area = " + AreaCalculator.area(4));
For exception demonstration:

java
try {
    AreaCalculator.area(-5.0);
} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
USER PROMPT:
The assignment also requires a sentence explanation of why overloading is better than separate method names.

AI RESPONSE:
Here's a concise explanation you can use:

"Method overloading provides a consistent and intuitive API for area calculation. Instead of remembering different method names like circleArea() and rectangleArea(), users can simply call area() with different parameters. The compiler automatically selects the correct method based on the parameter types, making the code cleaner and easier to use."

Now I need to create the Main.java file. Can you give me a general outline of what should go in it? I need to test all four methods and include exception handling.

AI RESPONSE:
Here's the outline for your Main.java file:

java
package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question2;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Test circle area with radius 3.0
        // 2. Test rectangle area with 5.0 x 2.0  
        // 3. Test triangle area with base 10, height 6
        // 4. Test square area with side 4
        // 5. Add try-catch block to demonstrate exception
        // 6. Include overloading explanation comment
    }
}

I'm getting this Java compilation error in Eclipse:

"Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems: 
	Duplicate method main(String[]) in type Main
	Syntax error, insert "}" to complete MethodBody

	at org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question2.Main.main(Main.java:5)"

I have two Java files:

File 1: AreaCalculator.java
```java
package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question2;

public class AreaCalculator {
    
    // Circle area
    public static double area(double radius) {
        if (radius <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Radius must be positive");
        }
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
    
    // Rectangle area
    public static double area(double width, double height) {
        if (width <= 0 || height <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Width and height must be positive");
        }
        return width * height;
    }
    
    // Triangle area
    public static double area(int base, int height) {
        if (base <= 0 || height <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Base and height must be positive");
        }
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }
    
    // Square area
    public static double area(int side) {
        if (side <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Side must be positive");
        }
        return side * side;
    }
}


File 2 Main.java has compilation errors. Please provide the complete correct Main.java code that:

Has only one main method

Tests all four overloaded area methods

Demonstrates exception handling

java
package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question2;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test all overloaded methods
        System.out.println("Circle radius 3.0 → area = " + AreaCalculator.area(3.0));
        System.out.println("Rectangle 5.0 x 2.0 → area = " + AreaCalculator.area(5.0, 2.0));
        System.out.println("Triangle base 10, height 6 → area = " + AreaCalculator.area(10, 6));
        System.out.println("Square side 4 → area = " + AreaCalculator.area(4));
        
        // Exception demonstration
        try {
            AreaCalculator.area(-5.0);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    
    /*
     * Overloading is the better design choice here because all methods
     * perform the same fundamental operation (calculating area) but for
     * different shapes. This provides a consistent, intuitive API where
     * users don't need to remember different method names for the same
     * conceptual operation. The compiler determines which method to call
     * based on parameters, making the code cleaner and more readable.
     */
}
Step 2: Save Both Files
Save Main.java (Ctrl + S)

Save AreaCalculator.java (if not already saved)

Step 3: Run the Code
Right-click on Main.java in the package explorer

Select Run As → Java Application

Expected Output:
text
Circle radius 3.0 → area = 28.274333882308138
Rectangle 5.0 x 2.0 → area = 10.0
Triangle base 10, height 6 → area = 30.0
Square side 4 → area = 16.0
Error: Radius must be positive
The "duplicate main method" error means you had two main methods in your Main class. Replacing all content with the clean code above will fix this.

Try this and let me know what happens!
