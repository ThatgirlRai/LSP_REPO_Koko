Question 5: Reflection on AI Use in Learning and Problem Solving

In this course, I've used AI tools like DeepSeek and ChatGPT to help with learning and fixing code errors. When I got stuck on programming concepts or had compilation errors, AI helped explain things in simpler terms and showed me how to fix problems. For example, when I had issues with method overloading and inheritance, AI gave me clear examples that made these concepts easier to understand.

The biggest benefit was getting quick help with error messages and understanding why my code wasn't working. However, I found one major limitation: when I told the AI that the code it generated still had errors, it often just repeated the same code instead of actually fixing the problems. This taught me that I still need to understand the code myself rather than relying completely on AI solutions.

Looking forward, I think AI will be a helpful tool for quick answers and explanations, but I'll always need to check its work and understand the solutions myself. AI can suggest answers, but I need the knowledge to know if they're actually correct and suitable for my specific situation.
