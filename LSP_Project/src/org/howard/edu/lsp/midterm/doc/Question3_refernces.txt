    Key points referenced:
    - "Changes in a superclass can break subclasses" (fragile base class problem)
    - "With composition, you can easily change or replace components without affecting the main class"
    - Composition creates "has-a" relationships vs. inheritance's "is-a" relationships
    - Composition provides better flexibility and maintainability
