Question 1 Analysis - StudentPortalHelper Class Cohesion

a) A good class should have high cohesion - 
meaning it does one main job really well. When a class focuses on just one thing, it's easier to understand, fix, and reuse. Low cohesion (doing many different jobs) makes code messy and hard to work with.

b) The StudentPortalHelper class has low cohesion because it's trying to do too many different jobs:

- Calculating GPAs
- Exporting files
- Sending emails
- Formatting dates
- Processing payments
- Checking passwords
- Managing cache

To fix it, we should break it into separate classes:

GPACalculator (just for GPA math)

FileExporter (just for saving files)

EmailService (just for emails)

DateHelper (just for dates)

PaymentService (just for payments)

SecurityChecker (just for passwords)

CacheService (just for caching)
